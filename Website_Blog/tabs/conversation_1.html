    <h1>Insights from Oenologist Discussion</h1>
    <p>After a productive discussion with another oenologist who visits several wineries, we identified a valuable opportunity to improve our project. <br>

        The feedback received highlighted the importance of offering greater flexibility in controlling the cooling system of wine tanks for wineries interested in our solution, which also includes temperature control. <br>
        The oenologist's suggestion was to incorporate the ability to turn on and off the water pumps responsible for cooling the wine tanks, as there are wineries that also turn off the pumps when no tank is being cooled. <br>
        
        Previously, our project was limited to controlling only the solenoid valve, which could restrict the adjustment options and efficiency of the system for wineries that have this functionality. <br>
        
        We believe that this feature has a simple implementation and not only provides a more comprehensive approach to managing the cooling process but also offers a solution more adaptable to the specific needs of each winery. <br>
        
        Furthermore, reflecting on this suggestion led us to revise the design of our presentation platform for the Demoday. We decided to opt for a more simplified approach, abandoning the idea of ​​placing a solenoid valve in the tank. <br> 
        
        Instead, we will implement direct control of the water pump in the cooling circuit. <br>
        
        This decision not only simplifies the implementation of the presentation platform but also demonstrates more clearly and effectively the ability of our project to adapt and respond to market needs.</p>
