        <p>
            Temperatures are an essential variable on wine production and
            currently, in most of the winery, the temperature measurements
            and controls are made locally on the winery. There are a few winery that have this type of control, but it is
            designed especially for them when the infrastructure is being built. When the winery needs to expand their number of wine vats they
            need to do a new electrical installation. With this being such an important role, we believe that there needs
            to be a way of monitoring the temperature anywhere, with an easy
            implementation so that every wine house can have this type of
            system without having to do very big investments.
